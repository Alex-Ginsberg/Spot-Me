# Spot-Me

Spot-Me is a group chat application that communicates with spotify to create playlists reflecting the group's likes. To signup/login, the user simply needs to connect with their Spotify account. Then users can find and add friends and create a group with their friends. When a group is created, a playlist is also created in the creators Spotify account. The playlist will have the same name and description as the group in Spot-Me. Once a group/playlist is made, the group can send each other messsages, as well as 30-second previews of any song available on Spotify. If any sent song receives enough likes (the amount can be specified when the group is made), it will be immediately added to the playlist.
